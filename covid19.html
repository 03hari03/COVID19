                WHAT IS CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19)?<br>
                <br>This is a highly infectious disease caused by a new virus found Corona Family, namely Noble Corona virus. It
                is spread from person-to-person through sneezing, or coughing, human to human contact and contact
                with contaminated surfaces.<br>
                </p>

             <div id="#DO">
                 <h1>DO's</h1>   
                 <div>
                        <p><br>
                        1. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub. This will remove the virus if it is on
                        your hand.<br><br>
                        2. Cover your mouth and nose with tissue or a handkerchief when coughing and sneezing. Throw away the used tissue
                        immediately and wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub. The handkerchief must be washed by
                        yourself daily and ironed with a hot iron. In this way, you protect others from any virus released through coughs and

                        and alert them about your condition. Always follow the guidance of your doctor.<br><br>

                        7. If you are caring for individuals who have symptoms, such as cough and fever you are encouraged to use a face mask to
                        cover your nose and mouth for personal protection.<br><br>
                        8. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs/handles, car doors, elevator buttons etc. daily with
                        regular household disinfectant or soap and water.<br><br>
                        9. All travellers coming from countries affected by the Coronavirus disease should follow guidance given by doctors
